    "Chef QWERTY has been working on opening his own Indian casual dining restaurant. Once he has conceptualized his menu his focus shifts to a very impotant part of any restaurant, or establishment for that matter; the location. He decides he'll take some help from his old friend XYZ's who just completed a data science course online. XYZ is delighted to take on this project and assures QWERTY that he has come to the right person because data can solve most problems and give optimal solutions. He tells QWERTY that it'll take him 2-3 days to program the model as various factors such as population, demographics, competitors, cuisines, nearby farmers/wholesale markets for freshness of ingredients, untapped areas etc. need to be considered in order to pick the perfect and most profitable location. \n",
